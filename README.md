Using a very sexy HUD (insomniaHUD)

It would be better if you use [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.40.0.windows.1/Git-2.40.0-64-bit.exe) to install the HUD

To install the HUD you'll need to run git bash in  tf/custom

```git clone https://github.com/p3tr1ch0r/insomniaHUD.git```

Try to update insomniaHUD as frequent as possible (new updates are always getting pushed)
